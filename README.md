# 🔮 Decentralized Prediction Market on 0G Network

**Win real money by predicting the future.** Powered by 0G's verifiable compute infrastructure for trustless market resolution.

---

## 🌟 Why This Wins Hackathons

### Core Innovation
- **Verifiable Outcomes**: Uses 0G Compute oracles to verify market resolution with cryptographic proofs
- **0G Storage Integration**: All resolution proofs stored on 0G Storage for transparency
- **Real Utility**: Prediction markets have **$100M+ annual volume** on traditional platforms
- **Perfect 0G Showcase**: Uses 0G Chain, 0G Storage, and 0G Compute together

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Proven Market**: Polymarket did $1B+ volume in 2024 - clear product-market fit
2. **Superior Infrastructure**: 0G's 50 Gbps throughput beats Ethereum by 1000x
3. **Lower Costs**: 0G Storage ($1/TB/month) vs IPFS/Arweave (100x more expensive)
4. **Verifiable Resolution**: 0G Compute provides cryptographic proof of oracle data
5. **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design beats typical hackathon projects

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### **PredictionMarket.sol**
Main contract for creating and betting on markets:
- Create binary outcome markets (Yes/No, Team A/Team B, etc.)
- Place bets with 0.01-100 0G
- Automated resolution with 0G Compute oracles
- Claim winnings based on proportional payout

#### **MarketFactory.sol** (Optional)
Factory for deploying multiple market instances:
- Deploy isolated market contracts
- Category-based discovery
- Creator analytics

### 0G Integration

#### **0G Storage**
```javascript
// Store resolution proof on 0G Storage
const proof = {
  source: "CoinGecko API",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  data: { btc_price: 97500 },
  signature: "0x..."
};

const storage = new ZeroGStorage({ network: 'testnet' });
const { rootHash } = await storage.upload(JSON.stringify(proof));

// Submit to contract
await market.resolveMarket(marketId, OUTCOME_A, rootHash);
```

#### **0G Compute** (Oracle Resolution)
```javascript
// Off-chain oracle fetches API data
const response = await fetch("https://api.coingecko.com/btc/price");
const price = await response.json();

// Generate verifiable proof
const proof = await zgCompute.generateProof({
  input: { api_endpoint, timestamp },
  output: price,
});

// Resolver submits to contract
await market.resolveMarket(marketId, outcome, proof.hash);
```

## 📊 How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Create Market**: Set question, outcomes, resolution time, creator fee (0-10%)
2. **Place Bets**: Users bet 0G tokens on their predicted outcome
3. **Market Resolution**: Trusted oracles resolve with 0G Compute verification
4. **Claim Winnings**: Winners claim proportional share of losing pool

### Economics
```
Total Pool = Sum of all bets
Winner Share = (Your Bet / Winning Pool) × Losing Pool
Creator Fee = 0-10% (set by creator)
Platform Fee = 2%

Payout = Your Bet + Winner Share - Fees
```

#### Example
Market: "Will BTC reach $100k by March 2026?"
- You bet: 1 0G on "Yes"
- Total "Yes" pool: 10 0G
- Total "No" pool: 5 0G
- Outcome: "Yes" wins

```
Your Share = (1 / 10) × 5 = 0.5 0G from losing pool
Fees = 0.5 × 2% = 0.01 0G
Payout = 1 + 0.5 - 0.01 = 1.49 0G (49% profit!)
```
